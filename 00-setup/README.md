## Setup your credentials

A user has been created for you in an AWS account supervised by Stacklet, and credentials have been supplied to you separately. 

Use these credentials to configure your AWS CLI: 

```shell
cp .aws/credentials.template .aws/credentials
nano .aws/credentials
```

In this file, fill in the blanks after the `=` character. 

```init
[default]
aws_access_key_id=
aws_secret_access_key=
```

Start the container with:

```shell
docker run â€“-rm -it -v ${PWD}:/root/ stacklet/workshop:latest
```

Then test that your credentials work properly with:

```shell
aws ec2 describe-regions
```
