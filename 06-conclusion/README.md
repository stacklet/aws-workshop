# Conclusion

Today we covered a lot of ground. 

We went from having an idea as a company to deploying that idea on AWS. 

On that journey, we defined security guardrails around the deployment, which we encoded as YAML policies that helped us validate Terraform code. 

We then intentionally degraded our code to verify that we would be caught red handed thanks to runtime policies that evaluate each asset created or modified in the cloud. 

Finally, we developed another layer of security protection, policies that can actually fix security flaws in the runtime, and keep our cloud safe while we fix the code in Terraform. 

Moving to a well governed cloud is a journey. Today we saw how it can happen for new resources and projects. Stacklet Platform also works in brown field and helps create strategies to remediate the existing governance debt, whether it is tagging, security, compliance or cost efficiency related. 
It operates in multi cloud environments, as well as in the infrastructure pipeline, and meets developers where they live, whether it's Slack or JIRA. 

We hope you see why this type of solution can be a game changer in operationalizing governance, and look forward to hearing from you in the near future.
